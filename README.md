Classifying Breast Cancer Molecular Subtypes
Cancer is a complex disease with a high rate of mortality. The characteristics of
cancerous tumors are very heterogeneous; thus, the appropriate classication of
tumors is a prominent procedure in the correct choice of treatment. A high level
of heterogeneity was observed in breast cancer. Therefore, detecting the
molecular subtypes of this disease is a critical issue in Bioinformatics
